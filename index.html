      Now that we've looked at the architecture
      of the internet, let's see how you might</span>

      <span data-time=4>connect your personal devices to
      the internet inside your house.</span>


      <span data-time=7>Well there are many ways to
      connect to the internet, and</span>


      <span data-time=11>most often people connect wirelessly.</span>


      <span data-time=13>Let's look at an example of how
      you can connect to the internet.</span>


      <span data-time=17>If you live in a city or a town,
      you probably have a coaxial cable for</span>


      <span data-time=22>cable Internet, or a phone line if you
      have DSL, running to the outside of</span>


      <span data-time=26>your house, that connects you to

      <span data-time=34>a dish outside your house, connecting
      you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</span>

      <span data-time=42>Whether a wire comes straight from
      the ISP hookup outside your house, or</span>


      <span data-time=46>it travels over radio
      waves from your roof,</span>


      <span data-time=49>the first stop a wire will make once
      inside your house, is at your modem.</span>


      <span data-time=53>A modem is what connects the internet
      to your network at home.</span>
